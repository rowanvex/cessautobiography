						<h2>The start</h2>
					</header>
					<p>I was born in Antipolo City on December 15, 2004. My mother is a housewife, 
						and my father is a business manager. I come from a broken family because we no longer 
						live in the same house. One childhood memory I will never forget is when I accidentally 
						swallowed a five-peso coin. I was rushed to the hospital because I was so stubborn, 
						but I survived — thankfully, they managed to avoid surgery, and I fully recovered.</p>

						<h2>Experiences</h2>
					</header>
					<p>My school life right now is not easy because I am a working student. 
						It’s difficult to balance my studies and my job, and sometimes I struggle 
						to keep up due to my tight schedule and lack of time. 
						Still, I manage to push through and do what I have to do. Even though it’s hard, 
						I continue to fight for my dreams because I have no one else to rely on but myself. 
						</p>

						<p>Yes, there are times when I feel sad and question why I ended up in this situation, 
							but I remain thankful because I’m able to handle it. I know that the Lord is always with me — 
							giving me strength to face every challenge now and in the future — because I believe that no problem 
							is impossible to overcome.</p>

						<h2>Memories</h2>

						<p>I’ve learned a lot from life and from every challenge I’ve faced. Even when I fell, 
							I stood up again for my dreams. I’m determined to finish my studies, build a stable 
							and successful life, and repay my parents’ love and sacrifices. With faith in the Lord, 
							I believe I can overcome any hardship and become a better person, ready to achieve my dreams 
							through my own effort and perseverance.</p>

						<p>Below are the most cherishable moments of my life, or should I say pretty.</p>

						<h2>Realizations</h2>
						<p>The only thing I can say now is that I am truly proud of myself. 
							I’ve become stronger and braver, able to face all the challenges 
							that come my way.</p>

						<p>I can now provide for my family and support my studies financially, 
							and I’ve learned to stand on my own without expecting help from anyone else. 
							The things I used to cry about and be afraid of have now become lessons that 
							made me who I am today. I’m happy knowing that I’m doing all of this for myself — 
							no longer relying on my parents, but proving that I can handle life on my own.</p>

						<p>My dream is to have a stable career, live a decent lifestyle, and raise a loving family of my own. 
							I don't aspire to be the richest or most famous I just want to live a meaningful and honest life.</p>

						<p>Above all, I’m proud because I know I am never truly alone; the Lord is always with me. 
							He is my greatest source of strength, guiding me through every challenge I face.</p>

						<p>Thank You!</p>
